# To install the git pre-commit hooks run:
#   pre-commit install --install-hooks
# To update the versions:
#   pre-commit autoupdate

# Note the order is intentional to avoid multiple passes of the hooks:
# - django-upgrade produces broken formatting thus needs to run before black
# - ruff does refactor thus it probably produces broken formatting too
